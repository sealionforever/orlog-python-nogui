God Favors is what makes Orlog so much fun because they are extra superpowers that you can add to the game and you are using the powers of the Gods! 
You stack up a bunch of God Tokens throughout your game and you can have up to three God Favors on you, each one of them has up to three levels of intensity. 
Just imagine that your opponent has six health left and you have seven God Tokens left. You can, in theory, focus on gaining a single God Token and defend your health points throughout the Resolution. When you select a God Token, go for Thor's strike and choose the second level. This deals five damage to your opponent and you get eight tokens in returns. And the game will be yours.
You can get God Favors by beating Orlog players from all over the world of Assassin's Creed Valhalla. Just go to a village, town or a camp and there usually is an Orlog player waiting to take you on. You can find them by checking for the icon of two dice on your map.
These are the God Favors that are available and could see potentially more added to the list.
- Thor's Strike: Deal damage
- Idun's Rejuvenation: Health
- Vidar's Might: Remove opposing helmets
- Baldr's Invulnerability: Adds helmets / shields for each helmet / shield already rolled
- Skadi's Hunt: Add more arrows for each arrow already rolled
Note that each God Favor has different requirements when it comes to God Tokens, so keep an eye on how much you need to spend for each level.

Using Thor's might to gain an advantage is essential for a win. So far in all games, Thor's might made the difference. Thor's damage cannot be blocked by shields or helmets, so you're getting results for your effort for sure. The only way to counter Thor's might is to use a godly power to heal their damage. And even then, the opponent is spending favors to undo your spending of favors. It puts them in the position of reacting to you, giving you a tactical advantage. Saving favors and spending them on Thor is a simple, straightforward path to victory.
If you can make early use of Thor, then wait until your opponent is down to have health or below before you can even do five damage to you. If you are able to create such a distance between you and your opponent then do not hesitate to go all in and reel in your victory. 
It really depends however on who your opponent is. The AI of the opponent is set in such a way that they vary their strategy. And just that creates your window to focus on a single type of damage. Rolling five axes for example and watching your opponent's pick of one helmet, two shields, two arros and a hand fail to protect them from your assault. But in order to create such a situation you will need to have your opponent roll first so that you can tailor an even more refined strategy if they go first. So a little Game Theory mathmetics is at hand here. If your opponent pick a shield, go for axes, if they go for helmets, you pick the arrows. And with Thor your Resolution can go very fast and will do either a lot of damage or put your opponent on the defensive. 
So far the Thor God Favour is the best for all matches since it is almost impossible to counter. So use Thor's might but use it wiseley and you may get that trophy real quick.
