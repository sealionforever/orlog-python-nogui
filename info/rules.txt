As with any game, the goal of Orlog is to defeat your opponent. In this case you take away all their healthpoints which are located next to the player's bowl (the grey stones).
The game starts with a coin-toss to see who gets to roll the dice first and then chose whichever dice they want to play. There is a maximum times that you can roll and it is three. Same goes for your opponent.
After the three rolls you get access to the God Favor. Resolutions phase is up next and with each dice that you have chosen in that particular order and the God Favor too ofcourse. If you or your opponent does not win, the next turn starts. After the third roll the game will automatically use the dice faces that have been rolled and there is no more rolls after that. So whatever you roll last on the third try will be your dice. 
The game's resolutions can be very quick or it can go on for a while. It depends on who you are playing and your own playstyle. 
There are five different dice faces you can roll in Orlog:
- Axe deals 1 melee damage
- Arrow deals 1 ranged damage
- Helmet blocks 1 melee damage
- Shield blocks 1 ranged damage
- Hand steals 1 God Token from your adversary
- The dotted outline means that you have a God token at the start of the resolution phase
The dices are to deal damage, block it or to steal a God Token from your adversary. Next to that, the dices can also be outlined with a dotted line. This means you get to have a God Token at the start of the resolution phase, which is what you will need in order to spend the God Favors (more about God Favors later). 
Please note the following: The orange-bordered dice can have any symbol. For instance, a hand dice with an orange border not only gives you one token, but it steals another from your opponent.
There are six unique dices. Each one of them has two symbols with dotted borders. If you hover over the dices, you can see which dice has what options and determine if you want to keep it or roll it again.
